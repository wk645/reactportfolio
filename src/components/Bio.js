				Hello! My name is Zoey Kim. I graduated twice in 2017 -- first one at New York University in May with a Bachelor's in Politics (not Political Science, which NYU is very adamant about) and a Minor in History.

				Immediately afterwards, I was accpeted into the Flatiron School's immersive Full Stack Web Development program, where I learned JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React.js, and more. I built many projects in groups and also individually. Since graduation, I learned React Native, and currently studying Python.
